# Manuscript discrepancy log

Working checklist for revising
`outputs/manuscript/2026-09-10_Manuscript_CompareUQMethods.docx`. Every stage
appends to this file; nothing is deleted, entries are marked resolved.

Each entry gives what the manuscript says, what the code does, and whether the
fix belongs in the text or in the analysis.

Quotations are from the manuscript as extracted on 2026-09-11 (345 paragraphs,
108,164 characters, 98 unresolved advisor comments). Code references are to
commit `68ac3e2` on branch `stage-0-1-refactor`.

**Three entries seeded from the Stage 1 prompt were found to be wrong when
checked against the manuscript text.** They are kept below, marked CORRECTED,
because the corrected version is narrower and more useful than the original
claim. See entries 3, 4 and 6.

---

## 1. Monte Carlo sample size

| | |
|---|---|
| **Manuscript** | "Monte Carlo simulation (n = 10,000) was employed to sample ECCs from a probabilistic model". Repeated throughout the supplementary result definitions: "For each of 10,000 iterations, each of the four PDFs is ranked from 1 to 4". Also "of the 10,000 values sampled from a given dataset, roughly 2,500 values in the top 25th percentile are replaced". |
| **Code** | NB3 cell 21 sets `neccs = 1000`. The value 10,000 appears only in cells 17 and 18, which are annotated as being for the PhD defense rather than the manuscript. |
| **Fix** | **Analysis.** Resolved in Stage 1 by moving `neccs` to 10,000, which makes the manuscript text correct as written. No text change needed. |
| **Status** | RESOLVED in Stage 1. `neccs` raised to 10,000; the manuscript text is now correct as written. All pLCA numbers moved; see `HANDOFF_stage-1.md`. |

## 2. Normalization: weighted or unweighted mean

| | |
|---|---|
| **Manuscript** | Two statements that disagree with each other. The glossary says: "'Normalizing' a set of values means dividing each value by its mean so that the mean of the resulting set is 1.0. For example, if the values are [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], they are divided by the mean (0.25)". That worked example is an **unweighted** mean and matches the code. But the lognormal offset justification says: "because all datasets are normalized to a **weighted** mean of 1.0, the offset is consistently half the mean across datasets". |
| **Code** | `data / np.mean(data)`, the unweighted mean, in both the synthetic path (`datageneration.random_irregular_dataset`) and the empirical path (NB1 cell 12). Confirmed empirically: `mean_uw` is 1.0 for all 10,000 datasets to floating point precision, while the weighted `mean` has an interquartile range of about 0.978 to 1.022. |
| **Fix** | **Text.** Per Stage 1 amendment A3 the code is correct and stays as it is. The rationale is that the practitioner-facing threshold this study builds is of the form "if reweighting shifts a material by more than X percent of its mean ECC, weighting matters more than the choice of distribution", and a practitioner can compute an unweighted mean from a set of EPDs but cannot compute the market-weighted mean without already knowing the market shares, which is the quantity they lack. Change "weighted mean of 1.0" to "mean of 1.0" in the lognormal offset passage. The glossary is already correct. |
| **Status** | Open. Text edit. |

## 3. CORRECTED. "Mode count" naming

| | |
|---|---|
| **Original claim** | "'Mode Count' is a continuous modality index from `estimate_maxima`, not a count of modes." |
| **Why corrected** | The manuscript **already defines it correctly** in the glossary: "Mode count: Heights (densities) of all local maxima minus heights of all local minima, all divided by the height of the absolute maximum. Local maxima and minima are determined by fitting the data with KDE using Scott's rule-of-thumb to estimate the bandwidth." That is exactly what `customstats.estimate_maxima` computes. There is no false description. |
| **What remains** | The **name** invites a misreading, and the narrative text leans into it: "when the mode count is 1.0, all UQ methods perform similarly well. However, as the mode count increases..." reads as though it counted modes. A reviewer who takes the name at face value will read a non-integer "count" in Figure 4k and 4l and question it. |
| **Fix** | **Text.** Either rename to "modality index" throughout, or add a half-sentence at first use noting that the quantity is continuous and not an integer count. |
| **Status** | Open. Text edit, low effort, worth doing. |

## 4. CORRECTED. Outlier filter on dataset metrics

| | |
|---|---|
| **Original claim** | "The 27.5 percent outlier filter is undescribed." |
| **Why corrected** | The filter **is** described: "because this process still yields datasets with divergent statistical metrics, any dataset with a metric that was a statistical outlier relative to the same metric across the other datasets was removed. In other words, datasets with statistical metrics lying outside IQR +/- 1.5*IQR for each metric were removed." |
| **What remains, and it is substantive** | Two things are absent. (a) **The magnitude.** 4,131 of 15,000 generated datasets, 27.5 percent, are discarded. The manuscript never says how many, and a reader would reasonably assume a few percent. (b) **The IQR is widened.** NB1 cell 20 uses `iqr = np.max([q3-q1, std*1.35])`, not the plain interquartile range the text describes. For several metrics the standard deviation term dominates, so the effective filter is wider than stated. For `kurtosis` the plain IQR is 2.56 while `1.35*std` is 27.71, an order of magnitude difference. |
| **Also unstated** | The filter removes 1,061 datasets on `weight_outliers` and 824 on `n`. Filtering on `weight_outliers` preferentially discards the datasets where the weighting scheme matters most, which is the phenomenon the paper is about. |
| **Fix** | **Text**, unless Stage 2 changes the filter, in which case both. Report the number removed, state the `max(IQR, 1.35*sigma)` definition, and address the selection effect on `weight_outliers`. |
| **Status** | Open. Text edit at minimum. Stage 2 is reviewing the filter itself. |

## 5. Dataset size range

| | |
|---|---|
| **Manuscript** | "the size of the overall dataset, n, was specified by generating random integers between 3 and 1,000 using a logarithmic function". |
| **Code** | `random_logcount(lo=4, hi=1000)`, so the lower bound is 4, not 3. More importantly, the metric outlier filter removes 824 datasets on `n`, capping the effective maximum at **749**. No dataset larger than 749 survives into the analysed set of 10,000. |
| **Fix** | **Text.** State 4 rather than 3, and report the effective post-filter range of 4 to 749 rather than the pre-filter sampling range. |
| **Status** | Open. Text edit. |

## 6. CORRECTED. Lognormal offset of 0.5

| | |
|---|---|
| **Original claim** | "`logfit_offset = 0.5` is undocumented." |
| **Why corrected** | The manuscript documents it twice, and well: "Because many datasets had values too close to zero for a realistic lognormal distribution fit, the data were offset by 0.5 in the positive direction for distribution fitting", and in the discussion, "this study fits the data after offsetting by 0.5 to achieve stronger fits for datasets with values near zero. This offset is a scale-aware, consistent heuristic." |
| **What remains** | It is undocumented **in the code**. `logfit_offset = 0.5` appears as a bare assignment in NB2 cells 12 and 20 and NB3 cell 15 with no comment. |
| **Fix** | **Code comment**, not text. Note also that the justification quoted above relies on the "weighted mean of 1.0" claim corrected in entry 2; once that wording is fixed the offset argument still holds, since the unweighted mean is exactly 1.0. |
| **Status** | PARTIALLY RESOLVED in Stage 1. The constant is now `LOGFIT_OFFSET` in `src/fitting.py` with a comment explaining what it is and why it exists. The methodological question of whether the threshold should be estimated rather than fixed is Stage 2; see entry 15. |

## 7. The (1-capecc) divisor on cap rank frequencies

| | |
|---|---|
| **Manuscript** | "EC Reduction [Cap ECC / Mat Red] Rank #i Frequency: For each of 10,000 iterations, each of four PDFs is ranked from 1 to 4 based on which dataset resulted in the greatest to least reduction from this intervention. [It] represents the percentage of iterations in which a given dataset is 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th." A plain percentage of iterations. |
| **Code** | NB3 cell 21 computes `df_rank = df_rank.fillna(0)/neccs/(1-capecc)`, dividing by 0.25 as well as by the iteration count, so the reported values are four times a percentage of iterations. The inline comment concedes the problem: "Percentages look off because not all reduction strategies apply in all scenarios". |
| **Fix** | **Undecided, and it needs a decision.** Either the divisor is a deliberate conditional normalization, in which case the manuscript must define the quantity as a percentage of the iterations in which the cap actually binds, or it is a patch, in which case the code should change. The matching material-reduction block has no such divisor, so the two reduction strategies are normalized differently while the manuscript states their definitions are "equivalent". |
| **Status** | Open. Deferred to Stage 2 as a statistical judgment item. |

## 8. Variance inflation in synthetic data generation

| | |
|---|---|
| **Manuscript** | The generation procedure is described in sequence: sampling `n`, choosing modes with locations, variances and weights, then "Negative numbers were replaced with additional values generated recursively with the process described above... An additional filter in this recursive process was to exclude extreme outliers". |
| **Code** | `datageneration.random_irregular_dataset` contains an undescribed step between those two: `exp = rng.uniform(0.9, 4.0)` followed by raising every value to that power, commented "increase standard deviation of data to align with empirical ECC data". With locations in [5, 20] this maps values as high as 20 to 160,000, and it is the dominant source of right skew in the synthetic data. A reflection step follows, applied with probability 0.25, which is also undescribed. |
| **Fix** | **Text.** Both steps must be described, because between them they determine the skewness and kurtosis distributions that the whole Figure 4 analysis is conditioned on. |
| **Status** | Open. Text addition. Stage 2 is reviewing whether the exponent step should remain. |

## 9. Number of statistical metrics in Figure 4

| | |
|---|---|
| **Manuscript** | "Figure 4 shows the rolling average of W1 distance for each of the six UQ methods as a function of the 18 statistical metrics calculated for each synthetic ECC dataset, namely skewness ()." Panels are referenced individually from Figure 4a through Figure 4r, which is 18 panels. |
| **Code** | The recovered `metrics` definition resolves to **19** metrics, so the figure has 19 panels, a through s. One panel is therefore produced but never referenced in the text. |
| **Also** | The sentence ends "namely skewness ()." with an empty parenthesis, a broken cross-reference that must be repaired regardless. |
| **Fix** | **Text.** Reconcile the count, add the missing panel reference, and repair the broken cross-reference. Confirm against the regenerated figure which metric is unreferenced. |
| **Status** | Open. Text edit. |

## 10. Bandwidth rule, and consistency with the author's own KL2 paper

| | |
|---|---|
| **Manuscript** | Accurate on what the code does: "The bandwidth of each kernel... is determined using Scott's rule-of-thumb, which is a function of the size and standard deviation of a dataset (Scott, 1992). Because KDE is applied to datasets with variable weights, the effective size of the dataset is used". This matches `weighted_bw(..., 'scott')`, which is `1.06 * std * n_eff**-0.2`. |
| **What is missing** | No justification for choosing Scott over Silverman, and no acknowledgement that the author's own KL2 paper (Torres et al., 2026, RC&R 234, 109022) uses Silverman's rule and justifies it explicitly. A reviewer who knows the KL2 paper will ask. Silverman 1986 and Sheather and Jones 1991 are both already in the reference list but neither is discussed on this point. |
| **Separate hazard** | `scipy.stats.gaussian_kde` uses the words "scott" and "silverman" for different formulas than the textbooks: its `'scott'` has no 1.06 factor and its `'silverman'` is approximately `1.06*sigma*n**(-1/5)`, which is this project's `'scott'`. The code sidesteps this correctly. Do not describe the method by pointing at a scipy keyword. |
| **Fix** | **Text.** Add a justification and reconcile with KL2. |
| **Status** | Open. Deferred to Stage 2 as a statistical judgment item. |

## 11. Shapiro-Wilk and Shapiro-Francia presented as one statistic

| | |
|---|---|
| **Manuscript** | "The Shapiro-Wilk test is used to assess goodness-of-fit for each dataset against normal and lognormal distributions." Figure 4e to 4h present the uniform-weighted and variable-weighted versions side by side as though they were the same statistic computed two ways. |
| **Code** | `customstats.shapiro_wilk_weighted` returns `scipy.stats.shapiro`, the true Shapiro-Wilk W, when weights are uniform, but a **Shapiro-Francia** statistic, the squared weighted correlation with normal scores, when weights are non-uniform. So `fit_norm_SW` and `fit_norm_SW_uw` come from two different estimators, and the same holds for the lognormal pair. |
| **Fix** | **Undecided.** Either the text explains that the weighted variant is Shapiro-Francia and argues the two are comparable, or the code uses one estimator consistently for both columns. The function's own docstring notes the two agree closely only for n >= 20; the median dataset size is 62 but the minimum is 4. |
| **Status** | Open. Deferred to Stage 2 as a statistical judgment item. |

## 12. Citation now published

| | |
|---|---|
| **Manuscript** | Two places. Inline: "these functionalities were not explored in this study (Torres et al., in press)". Reference list: "Torres, M. I., Lupton, R., Marsh, E., Srubar, W. V., III, & Allen, S. (in press). Using kernel density estimation and the Dirichlet distribution for uncertainty quantification of building material emissions. Resources, Conservation & Recycling." |
| **Correct citation** | Torres, M. I., Lupton, R., Marsh, E., Srubar, W. V., III, & Allen, S. (2026). Using kernel density estimation and the Dirichlet distribution for uncertainty quantification of building material emissions. *Resources, Conservation and Recycling*, 234, 109022. |
| **Fix** | **Text.** Update both occurrences. No other placeholder or in-press citation was found in the manuscript. |

## New, found during Stage 1

## 13. Infinite kurtosis for five empirical datasets

| | |
|---|---|
| **Manuscript** | Defines kurtosis without qualification: "Kurtosis: How heavy the dataset's tails are, measured as a scaled version of the fourth moment of the distribution." |
| **Code** | `customstats.weighted_kurtosis` applies a bias correction whose denominator contains `(n-3)`. Five of the 138 empirical datasets have exactly n = 3 (`AluminiumSiding`, `Electrical`, `Flooring`, `WallBase`, `WindTurbines`), so their `kurtosis` and `kurtosis_uw` are **infinite** in the shipped `TABLE_EmpiricalECCMetrics.xlsx`. Ten non-finite cells in total. Synthetic datasets are unaffected because their minimum n is 4. |
| **Consequence** | The supplementary empirical metrics table contains `inf`, and the empirical distributions plotted in `CompareUQMethods_SUPP_GeneratedVsEmpiricalMetrics.png` for the two kurtosis panels are computed from a series containing infinities. |
| **Fix** | **Analysis.** Return the biased estimator, or NaN, for n < 4. **Deliberately not fixed in Stage 1**, because the Stage 1 prompt permits exactly two number-moving changes and this would be a third. |
| **Status** | RESOLVED in Stage 1. `weighted_kurtosis` returns NaN for n < 4. Nine cells moved from infinite to NaN; no finite value changed. |

## 14. Synthetic datasets do not cover the empirical size range

| | |
|---|---|
| **Manuscript** | "The purpose of generating synthetic ECC datasets is to increase the generalizability of this study... by increasing the variety of potential datasets beyond that of the 138 empirical ECC datasets". The synthetic sizes are said to align "with the distribution of the empirical ECC datasets". |
| **Code and data** | Empirical dataset sizes run from 3 to **77,548** (`ReadyMix`), with a median of 37. Synthetic sizes run from 4 to **749** after filtering. Six empirical datasets exceed the synthetic maximum, including the two largest and most consequential material categories, `ReadyMix` (77,548 EPDs) and `Asphalt` (8,925). |
| **Consequence** | The claim that the synthetic set spans the empirical range does not hold at the upper end, and it fails precisely where the most data-rich and most carbon-significant material sits. Figure 4m discusses goodness-of-fit as a function of dataset size over a range that stops two orders of magnitude short of the largest real dataset. |
| **Fix** | **Undecided.** Either extend the synthetic size range, or state the limitation explicitly and bound the conclusions to n <= 749. |
| **Status** | Open. Carried to Stage 2. |

## 15. The lognormal threshold, and why the offset exists

| | |
|---|---|
| **Manuscript** | "Because many datasets had values too close to zero for a realistic lognormal distribution fit, the data were offset by 0.5 in the positive direction for distribution fitting." |
| **Investigated in Stage 1** | The pathology is real and was measured. With the threshold forced to zero, a handful of near-zero values drag the log-space mean down and inflate sigma, collapsing the fitted mode toward zero. On `dataset3365` the fitted sigma is 2.54 and the density at the mode is 19.75 against 0.13 at the dataset mean. That is the spike the author remembers. |
| **Scale of the problem** | Worse in the real data than the synthetic. 28.3% of the 138 empirical datasets have a minimum below 1% of their mean, and 19.6% below 0.1%, against 1.8% and 0.20% of the synthetic datasets. |
| **What the offset actually is** | A 3-parameter lognormal with the threshold fixed at -0.5 rather than estimated. Its effect is material: across 1,500 datasets it improves the lognormal fit in 73.9% of cases, median -7.4% W1, and moves the head-to-head against the normal from 35.0% to 43.9%. |
| **Estimating the threshold instead** | Better on average, mean W1 0.12033 against 0.12372 for the fixed offset and 0.15584 for no offset, and better in 76.1% of datasets. Two caveats: as the threshold goes to minus infinity the lognormal converges to a normal, which the author considers a feature rather than a bug, and the MLE still failed on the worst spike case. |
| **Fix** | **Analysis, in Stage 2.** Estimate the threshold. Declare the lognormal as a three-parameter family and state parameter counts plainly, because W1 is an in-sample criterion with no complexity penalty and KDE is more flexible still. Consider a held-out or cross-validated W1 as a robustness check. Fix the cleaning first, entry 16, since that removes much of the pathology at source. |
| **Status** | Open. Stage 2. |

## 16. The low-end cleaning filter never binds

| | |
|---|---|
| **Manuscript** | "Extreme outliers were also discarded, which were defined as outside IQR +/- 3*IQR." |
| **Code** | The bound is computed additively, `Q1 - 3*IQR`, on strictly positive right-skewed data. That bound is **negative in 128 of the 138 empirical datasets (93%)**, so it can never bind. High outliers are removed; low ones never are. |
| **Consequence** | `ReadyMix` retains a value at **3.1e-17 of its mean**, next to a median of 335. A ready-mix concrete EPD reporting that is a data error, not a product. It is also the single value most responsible for the lognormal pathology in entry 15. |
| **Fix** | **Analysis, in Stage 2.** A multiplicative filter, IQR in log space, where the data are roughly symmetric. Tested on ReadyMix it keeps 77,439 of 77,548 values with bounds [90.6, 1240], a physically sensible range, while the additive filter keeps all 77,548. Synthetic generation needs a matching floor so it cannot manufacture values orders of magnitude below the mean either. |
| **Status** | Open. Stage 2. |

## 17. Monte Carlo noise was never quantified

| | |
|---|---|
| **Manuscript** | Reports differences between UQ methods in pLCA results without stating the Monte Carlo uncertainty of those differences. |
| **Measured in Stage 1** | Comparing two runs that differ only in their random draws, at neccs=1000: the noise in `eci_rank_1` is 0.0149 on average, which is 15.5% of that result's standard deviation across datasets, matching the theoretical standard error of 0.0158 for a proportion at n=1000. |
| **Consequence for the central claim** | All 15 pairs of UQ methods differ by 2.2x to 4.0x the noise, so the claim that UQ method choice changes pLCA outcomes does hold. But the weakest pairs sat only 2.2x above noise at the sample size actually used. At neccs=10000 the floor falls to about 0.0047 and those comparisons rise to roughly 7x. |
| **Fix** | **Text.** State the Monte Carlo standard error alongside the reported differences. The numbers above are available in `tests/fixtures/plca/README.md`. |
| **Status** | Open. Text addition, once the Stage 2 regeneration is complete and the figures are final. |

## 18. Scoring grid includes zero

| | |
|---|---|
| **Code** | The W1 scoring grid runs from exactly 0, so the model is truncated to [0, inf) and renormalized, while the pLCA rejection sampling discards draws `<= 0`, giving (0, inf). |
| **Consequence** | Negligible numerically, but the two are not the same set, and the author's position is that zero is not an acceptable ECC. |
| **Fix** | **Code.** Make the scoring grid open at zero so the model scored is exactly the model sampled. |
| **Status** | Open. Stage 2, low priority. |
